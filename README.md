# NWCenter
NWCenter provides you some tools to perform analysis on your home network.
It comes along with two shell scripts, one for Powershell and one for Bash, that allow you
to create logs you can later analyze with integrated tools.

##Project goal
The goal of this project is to **simplify** network analysis in order to provide a software that **everyone**
can use on their own network.

##CLI
NWCenter has got a custom command-line interface you can use to execute your commands.
The CLI is designed to be the most user-friendly possible: no abbreviated commands (*e.g., "clear" instead of "cls"*) or too verbose commands.
Clear commands doesn't mean powerless commands: NWCenter provides several options users can try in order to customize their analysis with this tool.

##Feedback and help
This software is for everyone: from IT experts and programmers to people who don't know what programming means: because of that,
feel free to suggest things or ask for help [here](https://github.com/ale97dro/NWCenter/issues).
Before open a new issue, please check first if someone has already done that: in this way you can help to keep clean the section and not create duplicates.

After that, choose the correct [label](https://github.com/ale97dro/NWCenter/labels) for your issue. There are a lot of labels you can choose, for example:
* bug: if something isn't working properly
* documentation: if you think there are lacks in the documentation or parts of it are bad-written
* help: as user, if you need help with some features or configurations
* new feature: suggest something new to add or something to enhanced
* question: as developer, if you have doubts about the code or want some further information about the software architecture
